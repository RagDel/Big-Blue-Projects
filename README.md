# Big-Blue-Projects
Semi-Simplified presentations of our work to business supervisors

Our combined branches achieved actionable insights.
Project development was time-restricted to ~7 hours each.

Most of our thinking process and algorithms used with ML and Clustering 
are intentionally not presented, to keep our data storytelling concise and simple.

Co-operated with Data Science co-learners Marios Gravias & Konstantinos Chalepas.
