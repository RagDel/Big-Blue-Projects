# Big-Blue-Projects
Semi-Simplified presentations of our work to business supervisors

Co-operated with co-learners Marios Gravias & Konstantinos Chalepas

Our combined branches achieved actionable insights.

Most of our thinking process and algorithms used with ML and Clustering 
are purposefully not presented, to keep our data storytelling concise and simple.
